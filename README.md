## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I attempted designing a webpage using mobile-first workflow for the first time, I gained more experience in implementing media queries for responsiveness.
I also learned how to use the marker pseudo functionality to style just the markers of a list and gained more experience creating reusable css classes for styling.

### Continued development

I would like to improve on my mobile-first workflow while designing websites, I also want to get more comfortable with media queries. As time goes on I intend to use javascript frameworks to design the challenges.
